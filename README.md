#Macrosoft Paint

Macrosoft Paint brings the magic and joy of Microsoft Paint to MacOS. This is merely a front-end design and the real thing is a work in progress. If you want to get a taste of what's to come, open the site and press "Launch App."



P.S. I worked on this and the majority of my projects in Codepen (front-end playground) so the commits might be funny.
